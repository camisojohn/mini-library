Activity: Mini Online Library System (MERN + JWT + RBAC)

Instructions

    Create a mini Online Library System using the MERN Stack that allows two types of users — Admin and User — to interact with a simple book collection.

This activity focuses on:
- Basic login and registration
- JWT authentication
- Role-based access control
- CRUD (Add and View Books)

In this system:
- Admin can add new books and view all books. 
- The user can only view books. 
- Unauthorized users are restricted from accessing admin routes. 

Activity Requirement: 
- Create a simple login and registration form (NOTE: the password should be encrypted). 
- Implement the JWT verification middleware to protect routes
- Create a role-based middleware to allow only admins to add books.
